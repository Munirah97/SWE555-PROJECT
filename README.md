Visitor Management System
================================================================================
This project was made as project as course project of KFUPM's SWE555-Embedded Software Engineering

What is Visitor Management System (VMS)?
----------------------------------------
VMS is a an embedded solution that focuses on making visitors experience better, and provide safe and guarded enviornment for whoever implement this physically and the visitors themselves.

Requirements
------------
The implementation was made through simulation software, the steps to download the software as follows: 
1.  Create an account in [SkillsForAll](https://skillsforall.com) or [Cisco Academy](https://www.netacad.com)
2.  The Lastest Version of [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://skillsforall.com/resources/lab-downloads?courseLang=en-US)
3.  Packet tracer is compatiple with these `OS` Only: Linux, Windows, MAC OS 
 
How to Run
----------
- Clone this respiratory through Git or by downloading Zip file.
- Run `SWE Project Simulation.pkt` through Cisco Packet Tracer. 
- Make Sure all MCUs and sensors are running by double clicking them, hitting advanced settings at the righ-down corner, and choosing Programming Tab.
- Make Sure that environemt Simulation Time Scale is set to 1 Second(s) is equal to 30 simulated Minute(s) to notice changes over time.
- You can interact with sensors by moving the mouse cusor and pressing alt in the same time.
